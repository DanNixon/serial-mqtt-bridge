# Serial-MQTT bridge [![CI](https://github.com/DanNixon/serial-mqtt-bridge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/DanNixon/serial-mqtt-bridge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A simple bridge that provides access to a serial device via MQTT.

Written solely to make an Epson TM-T88III accessible over a slightly adverse network topology.
Not tested with anything else, probably not an amazing idea in general, but worked well enough for this.
